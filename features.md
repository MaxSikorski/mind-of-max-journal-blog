# My list of features to add in the future to improve my blog #

<br>
<br>


• I'd like to be able to make the page somehow interactive for readers so they can easily go and favorite which ones they like. Maybe even in a future place be able to comment on the posts.
<br>
• I also want to make sure that I am posting all this to my NPUB first, and then it gets relayed over to this GitHub page.
<br>
• Also I want to make sure that I can add images and video and other links to each part of the blog and obviously a sources page in the footer, so I can easily go and have readers be able to find the exact sources based on what I wrote the blog on.

* *I'm using STT (Speech to text) to be able to easily brain dump all the feature ideas that I'd like to have. I will go back and make sure to re-edit this markdown file. So it's in much cleaner markdown format. And specific tasks that as features that I'd like to complete.* *
