# My list of features to add in the future to improve my blog #


• I'd like to be able to make the page somehow interactive for readers so they can easily go and favorite which ones they like. Maybe even in a future place be able to comment on the posts.
<br>
• I also want to make sure that I am posting all this to my NPUB first, and then it gets relayed over to this GitHub page.

* *I'm using STT (Speech to text) to be able to easily brain dump all the feature ideas that I'd like to have. I will go back and make sure to re-edit this markdown file. So it's in much cleaner markdown format. And specific tasks that as features that I'd like to complete.* *
