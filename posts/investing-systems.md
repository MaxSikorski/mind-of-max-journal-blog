# The Convergence of Systems: Investing and Engineering

Welcome to my journal. This space is dedicated to exploring the intersection of value investing, robotics, and manufacturing. As **Ray Dalio** suggests, "Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life." This blog is my process for documenting those principles.

## The Strategy
Whether it's a **Buffett-style** moat or a perfectly tuned **3D printer**, the goal is the same: reducing entropy and maximizing output.

### Technical Analysis
If I’m sharing code or robotics data, it looks like this:
```python
def compound_interest(p, r, t):
    # Systemic growth formula
    return p * (1 + r)**t
